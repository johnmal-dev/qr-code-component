## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- PureRef Images App
- Less CSS

### What I learned
- How to use Less CSS
```css
body {
  ...
  .container {
    ...
    .card {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```
- How to implement Less CSS Variables
```css
@light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
@grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
@dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
```


### Continued development

An example video used SCSS CSS preprocessor. Without a CSS preprocessor, my code was less organized. For my next project, I will use the Less CSS extension.

### Useful resources

- [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) - This helped me compare my work to the provided example images. I really liked this app and will use it going forward.
- [Less CSS](https://lesscss.org/) - Less (which stands for Leaner Style Sheets) is a backwards-compatible language extension for CSS. This made for a quicker, cleaner CSS coding experience.
- [Koala App](http://koala-app.com/) - Koala is a GUI application for Less (and other preprocessors!) that automatically converts my .less files to .css files.
